                    <p>Water pollution is a critical environmental issue that affects ecosystems, human health, and economies worldwide. 
                        It occurs when harmful substances such as chemicals, waste products, and pathogens are introduced into water bodies, rendering them unsafe for consumption and damaging aquatic ecosystems.
                        Sources of water pollution are diverse and include industrial discharge, agricultural runoff, sewage, plastic waste, and oil spills. Each of these sources contributes specific contaminants that impact the environment in distinct ways.
                        Industrial waste is a significant contributor to water pollution. Factories and manufacturing plants often discharge untreated or inadequately treated wastewater into rivers, lakes, and oceans.
                        This wastewater contains toxic chemicals, heavy metals, and pollutants such as lead, mercury, and arsenic, which accumulate in water bodies over time.
                         These chemicals pose serious health risks to humans and animals alike, causing diseases ranging from skin irritations to cancers and neurological disorders when they enter the food chain.</p>
                         <div id="abc2"></div>
                        <p>Agricultural runoff is another major source of pollution, as fertilizers and pesticides used in farming are washed into nearby streams, rivers, and groundwater.
                        High levels of nitrogen and phosphorus from fertilizers can lead to nutrient pollution, which fuels excessive growth of algae in water bodiesâ€”a phenomenon known as eutrophication.
                        This can result in harmful algal blooms (HABs) that deplete oxygen in the water, creating "dead zones" where aquatic life cannot survive. 
                        The effects of HABs are far-reaching, affecting biodiversity, reducing fish populations, and impacting industries reliant on fishing and tourism.</p>

            <div id="abc">
                <div id="abc1"><p>Sewage and wastewater pollution also severely impact water quality. In many parts of the world, untreated or partially treated sewage is discharged directly into water bodies, carrying with it pathogens like bacteria, viruses, and parasites.
                 This contamination poses a direct threat to human health, as people who come into contact with or consume this polluted water may contract diseases such as cholera, dysentery, and hepatitis.
                 Furthermore, pharmaceuticals and personal care products present in sewage, including antibiotics and hormone disruptors, can disrupt the endocrine systems of aquatic organisms and even contribute to antibiotic resistance.</p>
                    <div id="abc2"></div>
               <p>Plastic pollution is an increasingly alarming component of water pollution, affecting both freshwater and marine environments. 
                Single-use plastics, microplastics, and debris from improperly discarded waste accumulate in water bodies, breaking down into small particles that are ingested by fish and other marine animals.
                 These plastics not only harm marine life but can also enter the human food chain, with uncertain long-term health effects. The pervasive presence of plastic in oceans has led to the formation of massive floating garbage patches, like the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, underscoring the scale of this issue.</p>
                 <div id="abc2"></div>
                <p>Oil spills, though less frequent, are catastrophic when they occur.
                 They coat the surface of water, affecting marine life that relies on oxygen exchange and damaging ecosystems, sometimes irreversibly. Spills can decimate populations of fish, seabirds, and marine mammals, as oil disrupts the insulating properties of fur and feathers, leading to hypothermia or poisoning when ingested.</p>
                 <div id="abc2"></div>
                <p>Addressing water pollution requires a multifaceted approach. Stronger regulations on industrial waste, improvements in agricultural practices to reduce chemical runoff, investment in wastewater treatment infrastructure, and public education on reducing plastic usage are all essential.
                 Additionally, promoting sustainable waste disposal and encouraging community involvement in cleanup efforts can contribute to reducing pollution. Only by addressing the issue from multiple angles can we protect water resources, ensuring safe drinking water, preserving biodiversity, and supporting the health of ecosystems and communities alike</p></div>

            Control of water pollution requires appropriate infrastructure and management plans as well as legislation.
             Technology solutions can include improving sanitation, sewage treatment, industrial wastewater treatment, agricultural wastewater treatment, erosion control, sediment control and control of urban runoff (including stormwater</p>

            <li><strong>Industrial Waste:</strong> Factories discharge pollutants directly into rivers and lakes.</li>
            <li><strong>Agricultural Runoff:</strong> Fertilizers, pesticides, and animal waste wash into water bodies.</li>
            <li><strong>Sewage and Wastewater:</strong> Untreated sewage released into water sources contaminates them.</li>
            <li><strong>Oil Spills:</strong> Accidental oil spills pollute oceans and shorelines, harming marine life.</li>
